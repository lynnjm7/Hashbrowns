Hashbrowns
==========
This is a simple program to calculate a set of hash values from a given text 
area. This app was built to play around with Objective-C extension methods, 
and to tinker with macOS Cocoa development. 

NOTE: This is not a production app, it is simply a toy for playing with some 
features of macOS Cocoa development. It would not be difficult to extend 
this program with some features to create a production app, but that was not
the intention of this project.

# Usage
To use this app, simply enter a string/text value into the input box and click
"Generate Hashes." A new window will pop up displaying the following hash 
calculations:
  * Base64 encoding
  * MD5 hash
  * SHA-1 hash
  * SHA-256 hash

To enter another string to hash, simply close the hash popup and enter a new 
string into the text field.

# Xcode
This project has been tested on macOS 10.12.6 with Xcode 9.1. Due to differences
in the Apple SDK, there is no guarantee that this will work on your system. 
However, there is nothing in this project that is outlandish and everything 
should work normally.
